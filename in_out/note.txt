ViewFilter
Syntax: [ViewFilter(ClauseNumber, FilterType, NotFlag, FilterTypeParameters)]

Request Item for the ViewData topic

Defines the criteria for the multiple filter to be applied against the previously named category (see ViewCategory).

ClauseNumber defines which filter clause is being defined, where ClauseNumber is between 1 and 4.

FilterType sets the type of the filter to apply.

NotFlag determines if a logical Not is applied against the entire clause. The NotFlag parameter must be specified; it may be either Not or left blank (by specifying the comma placeholder for that parameter). This is equivalent to the "Except" checkbox found in the Commence filter dialog boxes.

The FilterTypeParameters specified with this REQUEST and the ViewConjunction REQUEST are similar to those available from the Commence main menu.

Valid Parameters for ViewFilter
The FilterType determines what additional parameters must follow the NotFlag field. The parameters are summarized in the following table:

FilterType
 Filter Type Parameters

Field
 FieldName, Qualifier, Value, CSFlag

Connection To Item
 ConnectionName, ConnectedCategory, ItemName

Connection To Category To Item
 ConnectionName1, ConnectedCategory1, ConnectionName2, ConnectedCategory2, ItemName

Connection To Category Field
 ConnectionName, ConnectedCategory, FieldName, Qualifier, Value, CSFlag




Filtering by a Field

FieldName defines the field to be filtered.

The Qualifier depends on the field type.

Value specifies the value to compare the field against.

CSFlag determines if the comparison is case-sensitive or not. CSFlag is only necessary for textual comparisons. Values of "1", "yes", or "true" will force a case-sensitive comparison, while "0", "no", or "false" will force a case-insensitive comparison.

Note: The Value and CSFlag fields are not relevant for certain field qualifications. For "Is Blank" filtering and for Check Box fields, the Value and CSFlag fields can be left blank or omitted.

When filtering for a range of values, the Value and CSFlag fields are replaced by Min Value and Max Value. Range filtering always does an inclusive comparison with the specified minimum and maximum values.

Clearing a Filter

The ViewFilter REQUEST can clear a filter. To do so, specify the filter to be cleared (1, 2, 3, or 4) and include the word CLEAR. For example, issuing [ViewFilter(1,Clear)] will clear filter 1.



Filtering by Shared vs. Local status

The ViewFilter REQUEST can filter for shared or local items. To do so, see Filtering by a Field above. Specify either "Shared" or "Local" for the Qualifier. Leave the FieldName, Value, and CSFlag parameters empty). For example,



[ViewFilter(1, F, , , Shared, , )]

[ViewFilter(2, CTCF, , Is Employed by, Company, , Local)]



Filtering by a Connection

The ConnectionName, ConnectedCategory parameter pair defines the connection from the previously selected (base) category to a different Commence category. ItemName is the name of the item in the connected category.
